# Conclusion 
- The data displayed within the histogram informs the marketing team that trucks are their most expensive asset with a price sum of over $200M (This does not include pick-ups)
- The scatterplot proves that mileage and price are negatively correlated. As the odometer reading increase, the vehicle price decrease. This is a key metric used to determine vehicle value and appraisal.
